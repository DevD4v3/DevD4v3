I was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador, and I'm a passionate developer who loves creating [open source](https://opensource.org/definition-annotated) projects. My interest in programming was sparked by [SA-MP](https://www.sa-mp.mp) (San Andreas Multiplayer), a multiplayer mod for GTA San Andreas. Since I was 16, I wanted to create my own game mode on this platform, which motivated me to learn Pawn, a lesser-known programming language. I'm grateful to have discovered [SA-MP](https://www.sa-mp.mp), as it allowed me to develop my passion for programming and achieve my goal of becoming a systems engineer.

## My open source projects
- [DentallApp](https://github.com/DentallApp) - A web application that manages appointment scheduling, reminders and cancellation of appointments.
- [Capture The Flag](https://github.com/DevD4v3/Capture-The-Flag) - A game mode for [open.mp](https://github.com/openmultiplayer) (Open Multiplayer) created with .NET/C# and [SampSharp](https://github.com/ikkentim/SampSharp).
- [Protect The President](https://github.com/DevD4v3/Protect-The-President) - A game mode for SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer) where the President must survive for 15 minutes without being assassinated by terrorists or civilians.
- [DotEnv.Core](https://github.com/DevD4v3/dotenv.core) - A class library for read and parsing .env files.
- [YeSQL.NET](https://github.com/ose-net/yesql.net) - A class library for loading SQL statements from .sql files instead of writing SQL code in your C# source files.
- [SimpleResults](https://github.com/DevD4v3/SimpleResults) - A .NET library that provides new error handling using the [Result pattern](https://medium.com/@wgyxxbf/result-pattern-a01729f42f8c) without using exceptions.
- [CPlugin.Net](https://github.com/DevD4v3/CPlugin.Net) - A simple library that allows to implement a plugin-based architecture for .NET.
- [Seztion.Parser](https://github.com/DevD4v3/seztion-parser) - A class library used to read data from each section of a file (the file extension can be any, e.g. .INI).
- [AntiLag-Inc](https://github.com/DevD4v3/antilag-inc) - A library for SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer) that allows you to create zones where players can be shot directly on their skin.
- [system-jail-include](https://github.com/DevD4v3/system-jail-include) - A library for SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer) that provides an easy-to-use jail system that automatically handles player positions, interiors, and weapons.
- [P-Scanf](https://github.com/DevD4v3/P-Scanf) - A lightweight C library for safe and dynamic user input.
