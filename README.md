I’m a software engineer born in Guayaquil, Ecuador. I’m passionate about building [open-source](https://opensource.org/definition-annotated) products and tools, with a strong focus on quality, clean design, and maintainable solutions. Throughout the development process, I make architectural decisions and anticipate future issues that could affect the system’s evolution.

My programming journey started with [SA-MP](https://www.sa-mp.mp) (San Andreas Multiplayer, a multiplayer mod for GTA San Andreas), where I learned Pawn with the goal of creating my own game mode. That experience helped me build discipline, strengthen my technical foundations, and grow as a software engineering professional.

I’m currently working on my most ambitious project: an action roguelike game in Unity alongside my childhood best friend. Building a commercial game from scratch has been the culmination of years of learning through [open-source](https://opensource.org/definition-annotated), and it represents countless hours of practice, focus, and resilience.

**Stack / interests:** C#, .NET, software architecture, ASP.NET Core Web API, product development, and game development.

## My first commercial game

After years of modding and open source development, I began building my first commercial game with a friend.

I’ve worked as both programmer and software architect, designing core systems such as procedural dungeon generation, AI systems, and overall game architecture.

This is my most ambitious project so far:
- 1800+ commits
- 52 private releases
- 600+ issues closed
- Cross-platform architecture with a shared codebase for PC and mobile

## My open source projects

### Game Modes
- [Capture The Flag](https://github.com/DevD4v3/Capture-The-Flag) - A game mode for [open.mp](https://github.com/openmultiplayer) (Open Multiplayer) created with .NET/C# and [SampSharp](https://github.com/ikkentim/SampSharp). (~10 peak concurrent players)
- [Protect The President](https://github.com/DevD4v3/Protect-The-President) - A game mode for [SA-MP](https://www.sa-mp.mp) (San Andreas Multiplayer) where the President must survive for 15 minutes while being hunted by other players. (15+ peak concurrent players daily)
  
### Web Apps
- [DentallApp](https://github.com/DentallApp) - A web application that manages appointment scheduling, reminders and cancellation of appointments.
- [Playtesters.API](https://github.com/DevD4v3/Playtesters.API) - A lightweight and secure REST API that helps indie developers manage playtesters and control access to private builds using unique keys.

### Libraries

- [DotEnv.Core](https://github.com/DevD4v3/dotenv.core) - A class library for read and parsing .env files. It has over 550K downloads on NuGet, validating its adoption and usefulness within the community.
- [YeSQL.NET](https://github.com/ose-net/yesql.net) - A class library for loading SQL statements from .sql files instead of writing SQL code in your C# source files.
- [SimpleResults](https://github.com/DevD4v3/SimpleResults) - A .NET library that provides new error handling using the [Result pattern](https://medium.com/@wgyxxbf/result-pattern-a01729f42f8c) without using exceptions.
- [CPlugin.Net](https://github.com/DevD4v3/CPlugin.Net) - A simple library that allows to implement a plugin-based architecture for .NET.
- [Seztion.Parser](https://github.com/DevD4v3/seztion-parser) - A class library used to read data from each section of a file (the file extension can be any, e.g. .INI).
- [AntiLag-Inc](https://github.com/DevD4v3/antilag-inc) - A library for SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer) that allows you to create zones where players can be shot directly on their skin.
- [system-jail-include](https://github.com/DevD4v3/system-jail-include) - A library for SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer) that provides an easy-to-use jail system that automatically handles player positions, interiors, and weapons.
- [P-Scanf](https://github.com/DevD4v3/P-Scanf) - A lightweight C library for safe and dynamic user input.

## Fun facts / inspirations
I like to understand the **why** behind things — and I learned that from **C**.  
Thank you **Dennis Ritchie** for this great language 😍
