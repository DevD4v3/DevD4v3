### Hi, my name is Dave  üëã

I was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador, I am a very passionate developer and dedicated to his work. What motivated me to learn programming was [SA-MP](https://sa-mp.com/) (San Andreas Multiplayer, a multiplayer mod for GTA San Andreas), since I was 16 years old I always wanted to create my gamemode on this platform, for this reason, I committed myself to learn Pawn (it is a programming language, only it is not so well known) to achieve this goal. Good thing I knew about the existence of [SA-MP](https://sa-mp.com/), otherwise, I would never have been interested in programming.

I like to acquire and share knowledge. I like to learn from my mistakes, so I am not a dogmatic person. I like to learn from the person who knows more than me. I like to create and contribute to open-source projects. 

I like to know the why of things and I learned this from:

Thank you [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie) for this great language :heart_eyes:

I am currently learning more about C# and its .NET ecosystem but I don't rule out learning other technologies in the future.
